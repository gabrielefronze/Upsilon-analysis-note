\subsection{\label{Data}Data sample}

\paragraph{}
The $\Upsilon$ analysis presented in this note is based on the first ALICE \PbPb\sep data taking of the LHC run 2 at a center of mass energy \sqrtSnnE{5.02} which took place in November-December 2015.
A full description of the ALICE detectors can be found in \cite{ALICEexpe}.
The present study is performed by analyzing the reconstructed tracks in the muon spectrometer apparatus.
A detailed description of the muon reconstruction algorithm is given in \cite{simuSpectro, LongJpsiPaper}.
