\section{Introduction}

The Muon Spectrometer (MS) of  ALICE  have been used to measure the \upsi
signals in \PbPb collisions at \sqrtSnn = 5.02 TeV before the winter
shutdown of 2015. A detail description of the Muon Spectrometer and
ALICE deector can be found in Ref.~\cite{ALICEexpe}. A total of 241
\mub dimuon triggered data have been collected heavy-ion run period
and out of this 225 \mub data have been found suitable for data
analysis after the Qaulity assurance tests.
